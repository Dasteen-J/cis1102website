                    Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including the CPU, input devices like keyboards and mice, and output devices. Unlike software, hardware can be physically interacted with. In business, advanced and well-utilized hardware can provide a competitive advantage. As user needs grow, the performance of older hardware may decline, prompting businesses to upgrade to meet these demands.

                    Software consists of instructions that tell a computer what to do. It includes programs and routines necessary for a computer's operation. Initially written in machine language, software evolved with tools like symbolic assemblers to automate updates. As demand grew, the focus shifted to reusing components to improve productivity, leading to the development of Computer-Based Systems (CBS) and modern tools like Microsoft .NET and Enterprise Java Beans.

                    Internal computer hardware refers to the essential components inside a computer that enable it to function. These parts work together to process, store, and manage data, as well as power the system as these components are all interconnected and necessary for the computer to operate effectively.

                    External computer hardware refers to devices that are connected to a computer but are not housed inside the system. These devices are used to interact with or expand the computer's functionality. They include peripherals that allow users to input data, output information, or provide additional capabilities to the system.

    <p>
        System software is an operating system and its utilities, is responsible for compiling or translating programs into machine code and load them for execution. It controls a computer's internal functioning and peripherals. The principal system software is the operating system of a computer. This system software manages the hardware, data and program files, as well as the other system resources. Other components of the system software are the basic input/output system (BIOS), the boot program, as well as the device drivers.

    <p>
        In the field of medicine and healthcare, hardware and software technology plays a crucial role. For example, monitoring vital signs with a hardware-software medical system can improve a patient's quality of life during examinations, while also providing a quantitative assessment of their cardiovascular system's response to stress tests. This allows for evaluating the effectiveness of therapies. Additionally, studies have shown that using hardware and software systems to analyze a patient's cardiovascular system can improve the detection of dangerous heart disorders by 30%.

        In business, a company's success is often defined by the technological resources it possesses, which can help attract more customers than its competitors. While technology can be costly, it typically offers a return on investment as the business operates. Leveraging technological advantages can provide a competitive edge. Additionally, businesses use technology to reassess and redesign their processes, often relying on IT to address these challenges.
