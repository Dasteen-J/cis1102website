    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        Computer science has been a vital discipline and major in the field of technology ever since the emergence of personal computers in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s. This major has seen a drastic change such as an expansion of the research areas that has enabled a lot of growth in various agendas such as economic, industrial, business, and societal operations. Computer science has also been a huge part in the growth of other academic fields such as biology, digital health, digital humanities, and much more with the help of computations, simulations, and modeling which is part of the major's discipline.    </p>

        The discipline of computer science is more than "programming" which is what most people, especially students, see when taking up the discipline. Things learned from their mathematics and physics class can be of great help in computer science with skills like problem solving skills being fallen on deaf ears by the students, which, alongside stereotypes, are needed to be clarified within the discipline. This field has 3 paradigms that comprises its identity, "Theory" which is rooted into mathematics, "Modeling" rooted from scientific methods, and "Design" which is rooted from engineering.    </p>

<div class="others2">
    <p>
        Information Technology (IT) is practical and applied, focusing on the use and management of technology to help individuals and businesses access, store, and use information. IT emerged with the rise of the internet and covers areas like computer networks, databases, and systems that ensure everything runs smoothly. IT education teaches how to implement and manage these technologies in real-world settings, ensuring systems are functional and accessible.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>    
    <p>
        Information Systems (IS) connects technology with business, focusing on how technology improves business operations and decision-making. It combines technical knowledge with business principles to develop solutions that make businesses more efficient. Unlike IT, which focuses on infrastructure, IS uses technology to meet business needs, so students learn both technical and business skills.

        Computer Engineering is focused on designing and building the hardware components of computers, such as processors and circuit boards. Computer engineers ensure the hardware is fast, reliable, and efficient. This discipline blends electrical engineering with computing to create systems where both hardware and software work well together. Students in Computer Engineering learn how to build the physical systems that support software applications.    
    </p>

    <br>    
    <p>
        Software Engineering is about creating reliable, efficient, and maintainable software. Unlike the more theoretical focus of Computer Science, Software Engineering takes a practical, step-by-step approach to software development. Software engineers build large, complex systems that need to be scalable and dependable. This field grew to address the growing demand for better software development methods, and students learn structured processes to design, build, test, and maintain software systems.
